# StudrApp
Student App is an old project, which is in great need of refactoring - or built from scratch, that I wrote when I first started learning about Spring / Spring boot.
The frontend is built with Thymeleaf and the application is a student portal where students can register in different courses, get appropriate materials, upload homework and take quizes.
Teachers can upload course materials, check homework and quiz results.
